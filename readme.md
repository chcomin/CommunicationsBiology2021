This repository contains the codes used for the paper: Maude Bordeleau, Cesar H. Comin, Lourdes Fernández de Cossío, Chloé Lacabanne, Moises Freitas-Andrade, Fernando González-Ibáñez, Joanna Raman-Nair, Michael Wakem, Mallar Chakravarty, Luciano da F. Costa, Baptiste Lacoste, and Marie-Ève Tremblay. Maternal high-fat diet in mice induces cerebrovascular, microglial and long-term behavioural alterations in offspring, to be published in the Communications Biology journal.

The code was used for blood vessel, pericyte and microglia detection as well as for characterizing the interaction between these structures. 

Regarding blood vessel and pericyte detection and characterization, the code used in the paper has been reorganized (for readability and better documentation) and can be obtained in the following repository: [https://github.com/chcomin/pyvesto](https://github.com/chcomin/pyvesto)
